// controling custom Icons
Custom icons are placed inside tsx components, copied and pasted from figma into a simple mui SvgIcon component.
The viewbox should be as same as the figma icon, and shouldn't be changed at all.
To control the dimensions of the icon, just set width and height in its sx Prop. to control the color, change the stroke property of the imported icon.
don't forget to delete the stroke attribute from the pure icon code!
-- if any icons had a black weird and retarded shit on it, just put fill: transparent on the path tag.
